# Predicting Trip Duration of New York Taxi Ride using Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this project is to predict the duration of taxi rides in NYC. The NYC taxi trip duration dataset is from Kaggle competition. The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

The Dataset contains three files:

train.csv - the training set (contains 1458644 trip records)

test.csv - the testing set (contains 625134 trip records)

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Outline
* Download the dataset from Kaggle
* Data preparation and cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Prepare data for machine learning
* Predicting the trip duration using machine learning
* Conclusion and future work
